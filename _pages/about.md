Hi, I'm `Aldrich`. I'm a Master in Computer Engineering candidate at `New York University`
(expected graduation on May 2025). I previously worked as a Founding Engineer at
[Makmur.id](https://www.makmur.id),
a fintech investing startup focusing on mutual funds, stocks, and other instruments.

In my studies, I focus on advanced `networking`, `data centers`, `cloud computing`, `cybersecurity`, `high-speed networks`, `machine learning`, and `deep learning`.
Currently, I'm doing a project on DDoS attack detection on encrypted
data streams using Artificial Intelligence.

As a software engineer, I've worked on various projects ranging from frontend mobile
applications using `React Native`, web applications using `React` and `Next.js`,
backend applications using `Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `Python`, and `Java`,
and managing cloud infrastructure on `AWS`
(EC2, LB, Route53, ElastiCache, RDS, SNS, SES, etc.).
